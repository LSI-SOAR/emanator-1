Emanator is a software deployment tool designed to allow for a quick assembly and deployment of software builds with extensive project dependencies.  Originally designed as a custom GULP-based deployment tool for deploying NWJS projects, Emanator has grown to become its own stand-alone tool.

Emanator is extremely versatile and can be applied to any type of software project while supporting any operating systems that support NodeJs for portable releases, custom InnoSetup or 7z SFX installers in Windows or DMG image generation for OSX.

This tool is under heavy development.
